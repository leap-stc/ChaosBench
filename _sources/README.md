# ChaosBench: A Multi-Channel, Physics-Based Benchmark for Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Climate Prediction


ChaosBench is a benchmark project to improve long-term forecasting of chaotic systems, in particular subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) climate, using ML approaches.

## Features

![Overview of ChaosBench](docs/scheme/chaosbench_scheme-scheme.jpg)

1Ô∏è‚É£ __Diverse Observations__. Spanning over 45 years (1979 - 2023), we include ERA5/LRA5/ORAS5 reanalysis for a fully-coupled Earth system emulation (atmosphere-terrestrial-sea-ice)

2Ô∏è‚É£ __Diverse Baselines__. Wide selection of physics-based forecasts from leading national agencies in Europe, the UK, America, and Asia

3Ô∏è‚É£ __Differentiable Physics Metrics__. Introduces two differentiable physics-based metrics to minimize the decay of power spectra at long forecasting horizon (blurriness)

4Ô∏è‚É£ __Large-Scale Benchmarking__. Systematic evaluation (deterministic, probabilistic, physics-based) for state-of-the-art ML-based weather emulators like ViT/ClimaX, PanguWeather, GraphCast, and FourcastNetV2
