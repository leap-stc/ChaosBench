## Features

![Overview of ChaosBench](docs/scheme/chaosbench_scheme.jpg)

1Ô∏è‚É£ __Extended Observations__. Spanning over 45 years (1979 - 2023) of ERA5 reanalysis

2Ô∏è‚É£ __Diverse Baselines__. Wide selection of physics-based forecasts from leading national agencies in Europe, the UK, America, and Asia

3Ô∏è‚É£ __Differentiable Physics Metrics__. Introduces two differentiable physics-based metrics to minimize the decay of power spectra at long forecasting horizon (blurriness)

4Ô∏è‚É£ __Large-Scale Benchmarking__. Systematic evaluation for state-of-the-art ML-based weather models like PanguWeather, FourcastNetV2, ViT/ClimaX, and Graphcast
